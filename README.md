#Hello RD Station Team!

As we have a page with different content, i decided diagramming page elements separating the areas by differents background colors, this facilitates the reading because the user can clearly see the change of area. For the titles chosen a different font, thus gain more prominence (than just bold). I made the necessary adjustments to resize have no problems and I think I got a final result very interesting.

I hope you enjoy,<br>
